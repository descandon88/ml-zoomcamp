# CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)


- **EN:** Notes from the **CRISP-DM** chapter in ML Zoomcamp (DataTalks).

- **EN:** The CRISP-DM framework is a standard model to structure Data Mining and Machine Learning projects, dividing them into clear and repeatable phases.

<!-- ## Business understanding 

Do we really need Ml ? 

Case: 
-Our user complain about spam
-Analyse to what extent it's a problem
-Will Machine Learning Help ? 
-if not: propose an alternative solution ? 

Define the goal:
-Reduce the amount of spam messages, or
-Reduce the amount of complaints about spam

The goal has to be measurable
-Reduce the amount of spam by 50% -->

## 1. Business Understanding / Comprensi√≥n del Negocio  

- **EN:** **Key question:** Do we really need Machine Learning for this problem?  
- **SP:** **Pregunta clave:** ¬øRealmente necesitamos Machine Learning para este problema? 

### Example case / Caso de ejemplo  
- Users complain about receiving too much spam in their inbox.  
- Los usuarios se quejan por la gran cantidad de *spam* que reciben en su bandeja de entrada.  
- Analyze how serious the problem is (impact on user experience, costs, etc.).  
- Analizar qu√© tan grave es el problema (impacto en la experiencia del usuario, costos, etc.).  
- Evaluate if **ML provides a practical solution**.  
- Evaluar si **ML aporta una soluci√≥n pr√°ctica**.  
  - If **yes**: proceed with building a model.  
  - Si **s√≠**: avanzar con un modelo.  
  - If **no**: propose an alternative (manual filters, business rules, etc.).  
  - Si **no**: proponer una soluci√≥n alternativa (ej. filtros manuales, reglas de negocio).  

### Defining the goal / Definici√≥n del objetivo  
The goal must be **clear and measurable**:  
El objetivo debe estar **claro y ser medible**:  
- Reduce the amount of spam messages.  
- Reducir la cantidad de mensajes de spam.  
- Reduce the number of complaints about spam.  
- Reducir la cantidad de quejas por spam.  

üìè Example metric / Ejemplo de m√©trica:  
- ‚ÄúReduce spam volume by **50%** within the next 3 months.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúReducir el volumen de spam en un **50%** en los pr√≥ximos 3 meses.‚Äù  

## Data understanding
analyze availabe data sources, it's necessary to decide if we need to get more data. 

Identify the data sources:
- We have a report spam button 
- Is the data behind this button good enough?
- Is it reliable?
- Do we track it correctly? 
- Is the dataset large enough?
- Do we need to get more data? 
- it may influence the goal
- We may go back to the previous step and adjust it. 

## Data prepration

- Clean the data: raw data --> transform --> clean data
- Build the pipelines
- Convert into tabular form

## Modeling

Once the data its in the suitable format, then we can train our models. 
Which model to choose? 
-- Logistic regression
-- Decision tree
-- Neural Network
-- Or many others

Sometimes, we may go back to data preparations:
-- Add new features
-- Fix data issues 

## Evaluation
We select the best possible model 
What was the goal that we set? 
Is the model good enough? 
-- Have we reached the goal? 
-- Do our metrcst improve? 

Goal: Reduce the amount the "spam" by 50%

Do a retrospective: 

-- Was the goal achievable? 
-- Did we solve / measure the right thing? 

After that, we may decite to: 


## Evaluation + Deployment 

Oferter happens together: 
Online evaluation: evaluation of live users
it means: deploy the model, evaluate it

Deployment: 
here is the focus in engineering, monitoring, maintaniable, quality is good. 
Roll the model to al users
Proper monitoring
Ensuring the quality and maintainability

## Iterate! 
ML Projects require many iterations! 
 
Is it good o or not? Maybe is good now, but next year should be modified. Maybe need to adecuate the goal. 

## Summary 
6 steps in this process
-- Business understanding: define a measurable goal. Ask: do we need ML?  
-- Data understanding: do we have the data? Is it good? 
-- Data preparation: Transform data into a table, so we can put it into ML
-- Modeling: to select the best model, use the validation set
-- Evaluation: validate that the goal is reached
-- Deployment: roll out to production to all the users.
-- Iterate: start simple, learn from the feedback, improve.
