## Modeling

Which model to choose ? 
-- Logistic regression
-- Decision tree
-- Neural network
-- Or many others


Example: 
the model see the july, but it was used in august. 

train 80% | 20%

We have training dataset "TRAIN" and also a validation dataset "VAL"

-- From The Train data set we can take a matrix "X" and a vector "y" so we can obtain a "g" model
-- From the validation we can take a matrix "X_v" and also a "y_v"
-- the we can apply the g model into de Xv matrix from the validation data set, so we can apply g(X_v) = target_y_v

y_v = target
pred_y_v = predicted

pred_y_v     | y_v
0.8   -->  1   | 1
0.7   -->  1   | 0
0.6   -->  1   | 1
0.1   -->  0   | 0
0.9   -->  1   | 1
0.6   -->  1   | 0
2 not corrects
4/6 = 66% 
the model is 66% accurate

Comparing models would be: 
g1 Logistic regression 66%
g2 Decision Trees 60%
g3 Random Forest  67%
g4 Neural Network 80% 

We select the g4 as the best model. 

## Multiple Comparisons problem 
There is a problem with this approach. 


## Validation & Test
To avoid the multiple comparisons problem, we divide 3 sets, 
train data set 60%
valid data set 20%
test data set 20%

To make sure that the selected model is suitable we apply our selected model on the Xt from test data set. 


## Summary
1. Split dataset in 3 parts: 1. train, 2. validation, 3. Test.
2. TRain
3. Validate
4. Select the best model from the previus steps (2,3)
5. Apply the best model over the test data set. 
6. Check
